Hello, I am Ediz!
------

<p align="justify">
I studied mechanical engineering at Boğaziçi University and graduated in January 2023.

I love combining mathematics and software with my engineering knowledge. That's why I want to work on interdisciplinary research and projects that include these domains, such as computational modeling, machine learning, control and optimization. I also like to learn programming and computer tools that help me update this website and create content, such as Html, CSS, and I try to improve my coding skills in Python for data science and machine learning.

In my spare time, I enjoy participating in a wide range of sports, including tennis, basketball, and football. At my university, I engaged in various hobby clubs, such as dance, mountaineering, and skiing. My true passion lies in outdoor sports, particularly those that allow me to connect with nature and experience the world's beauty. In 2015, I started practicing kitesurfing and progressed to become an instructor over time. In the summer of 2020, I worked as a kitesurfing instructor in Izmir, Turkey, where I had the opportunity to teach people from different parts of the globe. Furthermore, I established a surfing community at my university in the fall of 2022 to introduce this exhilarating sport to more individuals and enjoy surfing together.
