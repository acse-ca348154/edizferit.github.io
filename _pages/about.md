Hello, I am Ediz!
------

<p align="justify">
Welcome to my personal website! I am a MSc student in <b>Applied Computational Science and Engineering</b> at <b>Imperial College London</b>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the <A HREF="/projects/">Projects</A> section, you can find summaries of the projects I was involved in. The projects include a variety of topics such as signal processing, finite element analysis, control, simulation, and a racing competition. All these helped me to build a strong engineering foundation. During that time, I discovered my true passion lies in combining mathematics and software to solve scientific and engineering challenges.

I grew up in Istanbul, Turkey, as a curious child. I guess it was my mom's encyclopedias that cultivated my love for nature. I studied <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> at <b>BoÄŸaziÃ§i University</b>, known for its excellent education and social environment. For my bachelor's project, I studied with Professor Hasan Bedir to create a digital twin of an oil heater cycle. I did an internship on electric vehicle battery state of health estimation at <b>FEV</b> and participated in an exchange program at <b>TUM</b> where I took classes on machine learning and control.

In my spare time, I enjoy participating in a wide range of sports, such as tennis, dance, mountaineering, and skiing. My true passion lies in outdoor sports, particularly those that allow me to connect with nature and feel the world's beauty. In 2015, I started practicing kitesurfing and progressed to become an instructor over time. In the summer of 2020, I worked as a kitesurfing instructor in Izmir, Turkey, where I taught people from different parts of the globe. Moreover, in the fall of 2022, I founded a surfing community at my university, introducing this beautiful sport to more individuals and enjoying surf activities together. While I won't be here to lead the community further, there are exciting plans in the pipeline! ðŸ˜„
