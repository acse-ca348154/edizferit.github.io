Hello, I am Ediz!
------

<p align="justify">
Welcome to my personal website! I am a MSc student in Applied Computational Science and Engineering at Imperial College London.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the <A HREF="/projects/">Projects</A> section, you can find summaries of the projects I was involved in. The projects include a variety of topics such as signal processing, CFD analysis, control, simulation, and a racing competition. All these helped me to build a strong methodological engineering foundation. During that time, I discovered my true passion lies in combining mathematics and software to solve scientific and engineering challenges.

## Brief personal background...

<p align="justify">
I grew up in Istanbul, Turkey, as a curious child. I guess it was my mom's encyclopedias that cultivated my love for nature or my father's science magazines. I received my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University, known for its excellent education and social environment. I also studied one semester at Technical University of Munich with erasmus program. I did my research internship at FEV, an automotive R&D company, and later I worked there for four months. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
In my spare time, I enjoy participating in a wide range of sports, such as tennis, lindy hop, mountaineering, skiing, and kitesurfing. My true passion lies in outdoor sports, particularly those that allow me to connect with nature. In 2015, I started practicing kitesurfing and progressed to become an instructor over time. In the summer of 2020, I worked as a kitesurfing instructor in Izmir, Turkey, where I taught people from different parts of the globe. Moreover, I founded a surfing community at my university, introducing this sport to more individuals and enjoying surf activities together. While I won't be here to lead the community further, there are exciting plans in the pipeline! ðŸ˜„
